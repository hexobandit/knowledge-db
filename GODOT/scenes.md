# Scenes

## Resolution
- Set the base window width to ``720`` and window height to ``1280``.
- If you're targeting high-end devices primarily, set the base window width to ``1080`` and window height to ``1920`` (crisper visuals & higher memory usage).
- Set Display > Window > Handheld > Orientation to ``portrait``.
- Set the **stretch mode** to ``canvas_items``.
- Set the **stretch aspect** to ``expand``. This allows for supporting multiple aspect ratios and makes better use of tall smartphone displays (such as 18:9 or 19:9 aspect ratios).
