# Example Mermaid Threat Model
## Simple Mermaid Threat Model for Web Apps with IdP, WAF, API, and DB

This threat model should serve as a starting point for any security review for applications using Identity Provider (IdP) authentication, Web Application Firewall (WAF), an API backend, and a database. It ensures secure authentication, protected API communications, and controlled data access. This model serves as a starting point for designing similar architectures.

ðŸ›  Architecture Overview
- User â†’ Client (Browser): End-user interacts with the frontend application.
- Client â†’ IdP (Auth0): OAuth2 with PKCE secures authentication.
- Client â†’ WAF (Cloudflare): Protects against common web threats.
- WAF â†’ Reverse Proxy: Handles API traffic filtering.
- Reverse Proxy â†’ API (Flask): Processes business logic and connects to the database.
- API â†’ Database (SQL): Stores and retrieves application data.

## Next Steps
- Think of logging
- Think of weak OAuth2 flows
- Think of input validations and parameterized queries
- Think of rate-limitting 
- Think of kubernetes infra threats
- TLS 1.2 or 1.3 everywhere
- Think of least privilege access for API to DB interactions
- And many many more... ðŸ‘€
