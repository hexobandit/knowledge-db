## Overview of Cloud Native Security (14%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### The 4Cs of Cloud Native Security
- **Code, Container, Cluster, Cloud**: Security layers to address vulnerabilities.
- **Key Practice**: Secure each layer independently and collectively.

### Cloud Provider and Infrastructure Security
- Use private clusters and IAM policies.
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- Enable logging and audit trails for cloud services.

### Controls and Frameworks
- Use RBAC, Pod Security Standards, and Network Policies.
- Align with CIS Benchmarks, NIST CSF, and OWASP recommendations.

### Isolation Techniques
- Use namespaces for logical separation.
- Apply Network Policies for pod-to-pod traffic control.
- Use taints and tolerations to isolate workloads.

### Artifact Repository and Image Security
- Use private registries and automate image vulnerability scanning.
- Sign and verify images (e.g., Cosign).
- Use minimal, patched base images.

### Workload and Application Code Security
- Scan code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Enforce Pod Security Standards (e.g., non-root users).
- Secure secrets with external tools (e.g., Vault).

## Kubernetes Cluster Component Security (22%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### API Server
Acts as the central management interface for Kubernetes. Validates and processes REST API requests, serving as the frontend for the cluster. Coordinates communication between all components.
- Enable RBAC, disable anonymous access.
- Restrict access to private networks.
- Use `--secure-port` and audit logging.

### Controller Manager
Runs control loops (e.g., node, deployment, replication controllers) to reconcile the cluster‚Äôs desired state with its actual state.
- Enable `--use-service-account-credentials`.
- Disable unused controllers.
- Use `--profiling=false`.

### Scheduler
Assigns pods to the most appropriate node based on resource availability and constraints like affinity/anti-affinity rules.
- Restrict access with secure kubeconfig.
- Enable leader election.
- Disable profiling endpoints.

### Kubelet
Runs on each node and ensures that containers in pods are running as specified. Communicates with the container runtime to start, stop, and monitor containers. Ensures containers in pods are running but **doesn‚Äôt assign pods to nodes**.
- Require authentication and disable anonymous access.
- Enforce secure pod configurations (`runAsNonRoot=true`).
- The `--anonymous-auth=false` flag disables anonymous access to the Kubelet API, ensuring that only authenticated requests are allowed.

### Container Runtime
The software that runs containers, such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O. Works with the Kubelet to manage container lifecycles.
- Use non-root containers and minimal images.
- Scan for runtime vulnerabilities.
- Restrict runtime privileges.

### KubeProxy
Manages network rules to route and load balance traffic to pods. Configures networking on nodes for pod communication.
- Use secure API communication.
- Restrict node traffic with firewalls.
- Monitor logs for unusual patterns.

### Pod
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers. Runs on a node and shares resources like network and storage.
- Enforce Pod Security Standards (`restricted` profile).
- Disable privilege escalation.
- Use resource limits (`CPU`, `memory`).

### Etcd
A distributed key-value store that stores all cluster configuration and state data. Acts as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of Kubernetes, backing up its entire state.
- Encrypt data at rest and enforce TLS.
- Limit access with firewalls.
- Back up regularly and test restores.

### Container Networking
Provides communication between pods and external services. Implements networking via CNI plugins like Calico or Cilium.
- Apply Network Policies for pod-to-pod and external traffic.
- Use secure CNI plugins with mTLS.

### Client Security
Refers to securing access to Kubernetes via tools like kubectl or API calls. Includes proper use of kubeconfig files, RBAC, and certificate rotation.
- Use kubeconfig with unique credentials per user.
- Rotate tokens and certificates periodically.
- Avoid sharing kubeconfigs.

### Storage
Integrates persistent storage with pods using Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). Supports dynamic and static provisioning of storage from providers like Azure, AWS, or GCP.
- Use CSI drivers and encrypt volumes.
- Limit PVC access to namespaces.
- Monitor for unauthorized access.


## Kubernetes Security Fundamentals (22%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### Pod Security Standards
- Apply Baseline, Restricted, or Privileged profiles.
- Enforce policies using Pod Security Admission.

### Pod Security Admissions
- Enable `PodSecurity` admission plugin for rule enforcement.

### Authentication
- Use certificates, OIDC, or tokens for secure access.

### Authorization
- Implement RBAC for least privilege access.
- Audit roles and bindings periodically.

### Secrets
- Store secrets securely using CSI drivers or external tools.
- Avoid secrets in environment variables or images.

### Isolation and Segmentation
- Use namespaces, Network Policies, and taints for isolation.

### Audit Logging
- Enable API server audit logging for traceability.

### Network Policy
- Restrict ingress and egress traffic with Network Policies.


## Kubernetes Threat Model (16%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### Kubernetes Trust Boundaries and Data Flow
- Understand API server, nodes, and pod interactions.
- Trust boundaries (Internet, API Server, Master Components (kube-controller-manager, cloud-controller-manager), Master Data (etcd), Worker (kubelet, kubeproxy), Container)

### Persistence
- Protect cluster data by securing etcd and RBAC.

### Denial of Service
- Enforce resource limits on pods to prevent overuse.
- LimitRange - CPU and memory limits per pod or container
- ResourceQuota - CPU and memory limits per namespace

### Malicious Code Execution
- Use vulnerability scanning tools and enforce non-root containers.

### Attacker on the Network
- Use mTLS for pod communication and restrict CIDR access.

### Access to Sensitive Data
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Restrict secret access with RBAC.

### Privilege Escalation
- Disable privilege escalation and use restricted profiles.

## Platform Security (16%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### Supply Chain Security
- Use signed images and scan for vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines.

### Image Repository
- Use private registries with access control and audit logs.

### Observability
- Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

## Compliance and Security Frameworks (10%) üõ∞Ô∏è
### Compliance Frameworks
- Implement CIS Benchmarks, PCI DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR requirements.

### Threat Modelling Frameworks
- Use STRIDE or DREAD to identify and prioritize threats.

### Supply Chain Compliance
- Verify artifacts with SBOMs and enforce trusted sources.

### Automation and Tooling
