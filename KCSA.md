### The 4Cs of Cloud Native Security

- **Cloud**
    - API server
      - Ensure internal-only traffic 
      - Use Network ACLs or NSGs to restrict access
      - Ensure internal-only traffic 
    - Nodes
      - Restrict traffic to nodes from the control plane via specified ports using ACLs
      - Allow access only for NodePort and LoadBalancer services
      - No direct node exposure to the Internet
    - Cloud provider API (Allows AKS clusters to provision Azure Load Balancers, Disks, etc.)
      - Apply Least Privilege Principle for IAM roles, service principals, or credentials
      - Restrict access to the cloud provider API to necessary users and services
    - etcd
      - Access limited to the control plane only
      - Enforce TLS
      - Enforce Encryption at rest (CSI Drivers for external vaults)
        
- **Cluster**
    - **Securing Cluster Components**
        - Use private clusters 
        - Enforce (m)TLS
        - Apply Network Policies for pod-to-pod and pod-to-external traffic
        - Enforce API AuthN (e.g., OIDC) (Rotate and expire service account tokens)
        - **API AuthZ RBAC**
            - **RBAC Authorisation**
              - Roles and ClusterRoles
              - RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings
              - Principle of Least Privilege for all users, service accounts, and system components
                
            - **Node Authorisation**
              - Kubelets can only access their own Node object
              - Kubelets can only access Pods bound to their node
                
            - **Node Restrictions (Admission Controller)**
              - Enforces additional validation rules beyond authN and authZ (RBAC)
              - Second layer of validation applied after RBAC authorization (kube native)
              - E.g., Limits the scope of actions kubelets can perform to their own Node object or Pods bound to their node
                
    - **Securing Apps**
      - Limit the use of hostPath volumes
      - Use Pod Security Policies (PSP) or its replacement (e.g., Kyverno or OPA/Gatekeeper)
      - Configure resource requests and limits to avoid resource exhaustion
      - Scan for vulnerabilities within code
        
- **Container**
      - Use trusted container registries
      - Image signing and enforcment (e.g., via OPA Gatekeeper)
      - Scan container images for vulnerabilities
      - Minimal base images (e.g., distroless or Alpine)
      - Runtime - Detec anomalies e.g., via Falco
      - Runtime - Avoid running containers as root & non-privileged mode & read-only filesystem, etc.
      - Runtime - Limit container capabilities (e.g., avoid CAP_SYS_ADMIN)

- **Code**
      - Use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools
      - Use tools like Dependabot or Snyk to monitor vulnerabilities in dependencies
      - Store secrets securely using encrypted etcd or external vaults via CSI driver

### Cloud Provider and Infrastructure Security
- IAM & MFA & least privileges, vaults
- Private clusters, network segmentation
- Encryption TLS + at rest for sensitive data
- Compliance & governance & monitoring

### Controls and Frameworks
- NIST - Controls with the five pillars: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
- CIS - Hardening guides
- HIPPA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
- PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation
- Tools to Implement and Validate Controls
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scanning
  - AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender
  - Policy Enforcement: OPA (Open Policy Agent), Kyverno, or Gatekeeper

 ### Isolation Techniques

- **Namespace Isolation**
  - Use namespaces to logically separate workloads
  - Enforce RBAC rules scoped to namespaces
    
- **Network Isolation**
  - Use Network Policies to restrict pod-to-pod and pod-to-external communication
  - Isolate clusters with VPCs or subnets
  - Configure firewalls or Network Security Groups to restrict traffic
    
- **Node Isolation**
  - Schedule sensitive workloads on dedicated nodes.
  - Deploy system-critical pods (e.g., kube-system) separately from application workloads
  - Harden nodes by disabling unused ports and services & PSP & Kernal hardening tools
    
- **Storage Isolation**
  - Use volume policies to ensure data is mounted securely (e.g., read-only when possible).
  - Isolate Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) Like Storage Account by namespace.
  - Encrypt storage using cloud provider tools or Kubernetes CSI.
    
- **Workload Isolation**
  - Use PSP (e.g., baseline, restricted).
  - Prevent privilege escalation (allowPrivilegeEscalation: false).
  - Run containers as non-root users.
    
- **API Access Isolation**
  - Restrict API server access using network controls
  - Configure RBAC to limit API access per user or service account
  - Disable anonymous and unauthenticated access
    
- **Multi-Tenancy**
  - Use unique namespaces, Network Policies, and quotas for tenants.
  - Use workload identity or separate IAM roles for each tenant.
  - Enforce pod-level security boundaries with sandboxing (e.g., gVisor, Kata).
