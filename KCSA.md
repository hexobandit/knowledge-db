### The 4Cs of Cloud Native Security
- **Cloud**
    - API server
      - Ensure internal-only traffic 
      - Use Network ACLs or NSGs to restrict access
      - Ensure internal-only traffic 
    - Nodes
      - Restrict traffic to nodes from the control plane via specified ports using ACLs
      - Allow access only for NodePort and LoadBalancer services
      - No direct node exposure to the Internet
    - Cloud provider API (Allows AKS clusters to provision Azure Load Balancers, Disks, etc.)
      - Apply Least Privilege Principle for IAM roles, service principals, or credentials
      - Restrict access to the cloud provider API to necessary users and services
    - etcd
      - Access limited to the control plane only
      - Enforce TLS
      - Enforce Encryption at rest (CSI Drivers for external vaults)
- **Cluster**
    - Securing Cluster Components
        - Use private clusters 
        - Enforce (m)TLS
        - Apply Network Policies for pod-to-pod and pod-to-external traffic
        - Enforce API AuthN (e.g., OIDC) (Rotate and expire service account tokens)
        - API AuthZ RBAC (verbs (get, create, delete, list) with resources (pods, services, nodes) and can be namespace scoped)
            - Node Authorisation
              - kubelets are only allowed to read their own Node objects
              - kubeletes are only allowed to read pods bound to their node
            - RBAC Authorisation 
              - Roles and ClusterRoles
              - RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings
              - Principle of Least Privilege
            - Node Restrictions (Admission Controller)
              - Enforces additional validation rules beyond authN and authZ (RBAC)
              - Second layer of validation applied after RBAC authorization (kube native)
              - E.g., Limits the scope of actions kubelets can perform to their own Node object or Pods bound to their node
    - Securing Apps
- **Container**
- **Code**
